two folders: server/db

route testing-
curl in terminal
-GET http://localhost:3000
postman

set up two different routes for app.get and app.delete

save spells in personal spell book.
GET all spells
GET saved spells
GET individual spells
DELETE saved spells

questions to answer:
for front end- where should the initial call go for the initial page load

persistent data should be saved
  where's it going to look for it?
  -JSON file?
end result is to put on resume that I created a RESTful api that does GET, DELETE, POST, maybe PUT

PUT, PATCH, or UPDATE would be used if spells are reordered

pageination
  -creates pages


step 1: consume api
used fetch api

dropped the express server and just moved to the react server. I'm able to put the information into a useState hook
